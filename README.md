# 🦠 Salmonella Image Classification

This repository presents a deep learning and hybrid machine learning framework for classifying poultry fecal images as **Salmonella-infected** or **Healthy**. It includes training, evaluation, and feature-based classification pipelines using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and traditional ML models.

## 🧠 Models Included in Massive Model Training

Both **with and without fine-tuning**:

- VGG16
- VGG19
- MobileNetV2 / V3
- DenseNet121 / 169 / 201
- Xception
- InceptionV3
- InceptionResNetV2
- InceptionV4 (*via keras-applications*)
- ResNet50 / 101 / 152
- EfficientNetB0 / B3 / B7
